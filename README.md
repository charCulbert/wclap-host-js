# `wclap-js`: use WCLAPs in the browser

The cleanest way to interact with WCLAPs in the browser is to write a C++ WASM host, which then exposes a simpler API to JS.  This keeps all the CLAP-specific structures in the "native" world.

## C++ library

The `cpp/` subdirectory provides `wclap-js-instance`(a `.h`/`.cpp` pair) for building the native side of your WCLAP host.

It provides an `Instance` implementation (as defined in [`wclap-cpp`](https://github.com/WebCLAP/wclap-cpp)) which abstracts all the WCLAP interactions (e.g. calling WCLAP functions, reading/writing structures in its memory).

## JS library

It also provides a JavaScript library (ES6 module: `wclap-js/wclap.mjs`) which can load any WASM hosts written using the above C++ library, and handles the corresponding `WebAssembly` instances.

Loading functions are asynchronous. Once the host and WASI modules are compiled,
the matching synchronous startup functions can be used in execution contexts
which cannot advance promise jobs during initialization. The top-level exported
functions are:

* `getHost()` / `getWclap()` - takes a URL and returns an "initialisation object" (including a compiled WebAssembly module) for the host or a WCLAP module
* `startHost(initObj, ?hostImports, ?createWorker)` - takes the initialisation object and (if supported) a function to create new `Worker`s, and returns a Host.
* `startHostSync(initObj, ?hostImports)` - synchronously starts the same Host from an initialisation object containing compiled host and WASI modules.
* `runThread(threadData, hostImports, createWorker)` - to be called from any `Worker`s that you start

### Host

This is the object returned from `startHost()`.  It has the following properties/methods:

* `.hostInstance` - the actual `WebAssembly.Instance`.  Any custom exports from your C++ will be in `.hostInstance.exports`. 
* `.hostMemory` - hosts's memory, whether imported or exported 
* `.startWclap(wclapInit, ?createWorker)` - takes an initialisation object and returns a Wclap
* `.startWclapSync(wclapInit, ?createWorker)` - synchronously starts the same Wclap from an initialisation object containing a compiled module
* `.getWorkerData()` - see `createWorker()` below
* `.shared` - whether this host (currently) supports threads
* `.initObj()` - an initialisation object which can be passed across `Worker`s to create a matching `Host`.  If cross-origin isolated, this will join the existing host as a new thread.

### Wclap

This is the object returned from `host.startWclap()`.  It has the following properties/methods:

* `.ptr` - this corresponds to the `Instance *` in the host's C++ side 
* `.memory` - the WCLAP instance's memory
* `.shared` - whether this WCLAP supports threads
* `.initObj()` - an initialisation object which can be passed across `Worker`s to create a matching Wclap.  If cross-origin isolated, this will join as a new thread.

### `createWorker(host, threadData)`

This function (supplied either when starting the host, or the Wclap) is called when the Wclap wants to start a new thread.  It must (synchronously) return a `true`-ish value if successful.

The `threadData` doesn't contain any shared memory or modules, which means it can be passed back from the `AudioWorklet` (which is otherwise quite restricted).

To get the data which should actually be passed to the new `Worker`, call `host.getWorkerData(threadData)`.  On the new `Worker`, this should be passed to `runThread()`.
